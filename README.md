# Tinkering Graphics Assignment
## Python Code for Re-purposing Graphics Algorithms

Prepared by Michael [Adrir](https://github.com/Adrir) Scott and Lord John [SnugglingBunny](https://github.com/SnugglinBunny) Rock

This code has been written as part of the Tinkering Graphics tasks in the COMP120
module at Falmouth University. The briefs which have been tackled are the *random 
number game* brief (mostly by Michael) and the *appropriation pop art* briefs
(mostly by John). Pair programming was practiced where appropriate.

## Instructions

Python version 3 is required for all projects.

### Random Number Game

There is a folder entitled guess_random, which contains a file called \__init__.py. 
Simply, execute this file as a python script to run the game. 

From the root folder:

`python guess_random/__init__.py`

This game only requires the terminal to play.

### Appropriation Pop Art

There is a folder entitled `pop_art`, which contains a file called \__init__.py and a folder for [images](pop_art/images). 

Put the `base` image you want to use in the `images/` folder. 

The default base image is a photo of Bill Nye by Ed Schipul which has been taken from [WikiMedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bill_Nye.jpg). 

Simply, execute this file as a python script to run the game. 

From the root folder:

`python pop_art/__init__.py`

A window should appear. Press `ENTER` to execute the program and admire the art!

## Licensing Information
