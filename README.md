# Tinkering Graphics Assignment
## Python Code for Re-purposing Graphics Algorithms

Prepared by Michael 'Adrir' Scott

This code has been written as part of the Tinkering Graphics tasks in the COMP120
module at Falmouth University. The brief which has been tacked is the *random number
game* brief.

## Instructions

There is a folder entitled guess_random, which contains a file called \__init__.py. 
Simply, execute this file as a python script to run the game. 

From the root folder:

`python guess_random/__init__.py`

This game only requires the terminal to play.

Python version 3 is required.

## Licensing Information

The MIT license has been selected for its simplicity, to be as permissive as possible,
and for its ability to maintain attribution as the license notice must be included in
any copies of the code. This includes in commercial use of the code. It therefore 
enables the widest possible useage of the code whilst recognising the original author
and their rights.
